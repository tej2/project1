<p> Hi! My name is Tiffany Johnson and I am a First Year Masters Student pursuing a degree in Information Systems. I currently work in the field of Architectural Restoration at an architecture firm in NYC. My ultimate goal is to work on Adaptive Reuse projects and Disaster Response projects. However, I would like to be able to have multiple skill sets beside architecture related ones. I developed a passion for User Experience Design after taking an undergraduate course in Computer Science. Ultimately, this helped me decided what I wanted to do my masters in. I have experience with basic website design and designing apps using Phone Gap
